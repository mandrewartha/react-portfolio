# React Portfolio

This single page portfolio was dynamically created using ReactJS. It displays 6 projects, a short biography section, a link to a resume, and a short contact form. Thanks to ReactJS, the page does not need to reload the HTML when moving from page to page. As a footer on every page, there is an icon for github and linked in that links to user profiles.
